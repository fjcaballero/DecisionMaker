# DecisionMaker
Helps you to make decisions. Pretty obvious.

It´s a basic pros and cons sorted list where you can assign importance or relevance to each item (by dragging them up and down) and the app will execute the maths and tell you what´s the better choice based on your preferences and priorities.
